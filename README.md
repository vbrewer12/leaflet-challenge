# Leaflet Earthquake challenge

## Overview<br>
This project is an analysis of earthquake data using JS Leaflet library to plot it on a map and showcase the magnitute of the data points.<br>

### Analysis<br>
The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudesdoes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. This data overall summarizes the capabilty of the plots of the earthquakes from the dataset.
